# TASK ONE

words = ["posterior", "tush", "rear", "ass", "arse", "backside", "bum", "bottom"]
sorted_words = words # Use an array method here to sort the words into alphabetical order
first_word = sorted_words # Select the first element from the sorted array

# Take the above steps and turn them into a function by adding them into the function definition below
def alphabetical_first(words)

    # remember to return the final value
end

# Uncomment the line below to check it works
more_words = ["todger", "member", "willy", "part", "johnson", "trousersnake", "phallus"]
print(alphabetical_first(more_words))

# TASK TWO

price = 100
vat_rate = 0.2
# Calculate vat_payable here
# Calculate price_plus_vat here

# Take the above steps and use them in a function that will add vat to an item
def add_vat(price)
    vat_rate = 0.2
    # remember to return the final value
end

# Uncomment the line below to check it works
# print(add_vat(1567.53))

# TASK THREE

# Write a function that tells you true or false whether a number is divisible by 4
def is_divisible_by_four(num)
    # Hint: This can be done in one line, with an expression that uses the modulo (remainder) you learnt - % 
end

# Write a function that does the same but for four hundred
def is_divisible_by_four_hundred(num)

end

# Now use the two above functions to calculate whether a year is a leap year
def is_a_leap_year(year)
    # The rule is:
    # If a year is divisible by 4 it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 400
    # There are several ways to do this, but two things that might be helpful:
    # '&&' means 'and', '!' means not

end

# Uncomment these to see if it works
# print(is_a_leap_year(1976))
# print(is_a_leap_year(1977))
# print(is_a_leap_year(2000))

# TASK FOUR
days_in_months = [] # Write an array of integers representing the days in each month
total_days = days_in_months # Use an array method here to total the days

# Use the above, plus the leap year function to work out the number of days in a year
def days_in_year(year)
    # Calculate days in a normal year
    # Add one if it is a leap year

end

# Uncomment these to see if it works
# print(days_in_year(1976))
# print(days_in_year(1977))
# print(days_in_year(2000))
